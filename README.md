# Transaction-tracking-website
This web site is simply build with HTML, CSS, JS to track the income and expense and display it in table format.
With HTML I tried to collect user data such as his/her income(credit amt.) and expense(debit amt.) through the input box.
I used CSS to make it look pretty simple so any one can understand what the web site is actually used for and tried to make it responsive so it can be accessible for pretty much on every device.
And last but not the least I have manipulated elements such as buttons, input values with JAVA SCRIPT DOM so user can see his/her transaction history in a well mannered tabular form.
